        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>My whole life my interests have come and gone. Some last for months or even years, other for mear weeks. However, art and the outdoors are two exeptions to this rule. I have always been an avid artist and outdoorsmen. 
            In art I enjoy everthing from 2D art like painting, to 3D art like ceramics. Art is a way that I can express myself freely. Never have a found the end to the outdoors. It feels like evertime I go outside no matter where I am at, from the middle of a busy city street, to a hikeing trail in the middle of no where there is always something new to see. 
            Japanese culture, art, and history is a mixture of both there interests. One that I have had for several years.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Miko's or Shrine Maidens have existed for centuries. They used to revered as powerful shamans. Over the years a Miko's role has changed. Miko's no longer preform the role of shamans. They now preform rutials and ceremonies at their Shrine. 
            While a Miko's duties have changed they are still viewed as an imprtant tradtion. Nowadays many Shrine Maidens are students or young women working part-time at shrines.</p>
