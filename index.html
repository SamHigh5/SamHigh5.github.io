        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>My whole life my interests have come and gone. Some last for months or even years, other for mere weeks. However, art and the outdoors are two exeptions to this rule. 
            I have always been an avid artist and outdoorsmen. In art I enjoy everything from 2D art like painting, to 3D art like ceramics. 
            Art is a way that I can express myself freely. Never before have I found the end to the outdoors. And I don't believe I ever will.
            It feels like everytime I go outside no matter where I am at, from the middle of a busy city street, to a hiking trail in the middle of nowhere there is always something new to see. 
            Japanese culture, art, and history is a mixture of both of these interests. Something I enjoy looking at and learning about, but at the same time doesn't seem to have an end to. 
            I have had an interest in Japanese life for several years. One of my favorite Japanese topics are Miko.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Miko's or Shrine Maidens have existed for centuries. I the past a Miko was revered as powerful shaman. However, over the years a Miko's role has changed. 
            Miko's no longer preform the role of shamans. They now preform live as assitaants to priests and upkeepers of Shrines. Miko also partipate as part of rutials and ceremonies at their Shrine. 
            While a Miko's duties have changed they are still viewed as an imprtant tradtion and are highly valued. Nowadays many Shrine Maidens are students or young women working part-time while still at school.</p>
