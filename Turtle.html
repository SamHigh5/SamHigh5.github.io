        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>This project is about using the Python's Turtle graphic module. I used the different functions (draw_rectangle, draw_triangle, draw_square, and draw_circle) to create functions that when implemented created a scene. I created two versions of this code the second which I refactored to work more smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Sample Code</h2>
        <p>The below code is a function that creates a tree with a rectangler trunk and 2 sections of triangle shaped leafs.</p>
        <strong>t</strong>
        : the t reprsents the turtle graphic.
        <br>
        <strong>jump_to</strong>
        : jumping the turtle to different pionts on the screen.
        <br>
        <strong>t.color</strong>
        : changing the color of the lines drawn by the turtle graphic.
